# JamConnect
A real-time music forum built on Meteor.JS

JamConnect is a work-in-progress built off the Discover Meteor framework. Its purpose is to connect local musicians who have no intentions of joining a band and just want to meet up and rock out!


##Quick Start:

JamConnect is built on the full-stack JavaScript framework, Meteor.JS - to install Meteor, run:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DinsmoreDesign/JamConnect.git
```

Run JamConnect:

```bash
cd JamConnect
meteor
```

Have fun!
